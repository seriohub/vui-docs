# For Enterprises

**VUI** provides an intuitive and powerful interface to help DevOps, SREs, platform engineers, and IT operations teams manage Kubernetes backups and restores with ease.

If your organization relies on Kubernetes in production, VUI can help you save time, reduce complexity, and increase operational reliability. VUI is open source at its core—but enterprises can go further with **Pro capabilities** and dedicated support.

## Why Use VUI in Your Organization?

- **Streamlined Operations**  
  Reduce human error and time spent on Velero CLI with a user-friendly interface for managing backups, restores, and schedules.

- **Multi-Cluster Management**  
  With the [VUI Core](/docs/guide/features/core) Pro module, manage multiple clusters from a single unified interface.

- **Visibility & Alerts**  
  Get real-time feedback on backup status, failures, and performance across your infrastructure.

- **Simple Integration**  
  Works with existing Velero installations.
