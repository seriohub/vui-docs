## 💡 Why Sponsoring Matters

Maintaining a production-grade open source project takes **time, effort, and long-term commitment** — not just to write code, but also to fix bugs, write documentation, support users, and plan new features.

By sponsoring VUI, you're not buying access to software — you're **investing in a tool you rely on**, and helping ensure it continues to improve, stay secure, and remain independent.

Sponsorships allow us to:

- Dedicate focused time to the project
- Improve and document advanced features (like `vui-core`)
- Respond to real-world needs from the community
- Keep the main components free and open for everyone

Even small contributions make a big difference.
