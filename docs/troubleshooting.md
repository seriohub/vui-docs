# Troubleshooting

## Unable to login

### 1. Ensure the API is reachable

As mentioned in the installation guide, the VUI interface relies on communication with the API service.  
The API must be accessible from the clientâ€™s browser.

- Try opening the following URL in your browser:  
  `https://<your-endpoint>/api/online`

If this page loads, the API is accessible.

### 2. Run a Diagnostic Check

From the login page, click the **Diagnostic** link in the bottom-left corner:  
![diagnostic-link](./assets/screenshots/32_diagnostic_link.png)

This opens a pop-up with a list of internal checks and their current status:  
![diagnostic](./assets/screenshots/33_diagnostic.png)

### 3. Check for missing `SECURITY_TOKEN_KEY`

In some cases, the `SECURITY_TOKEN_KEY` environment variable is not generated automatically.  
This can cause authentication to fail and loop the user back to the login screen.

To fix this, manually set the `SECURITY_TOKEN_KEY` in your API configuration.
