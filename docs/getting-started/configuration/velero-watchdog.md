# WATCHDOG

## Apprise Integration â€“ Draft Documentation

This is just a draft to describe the new feature integrating Apprise. A more detailed version will be available soon.

Starting from version 0.1.19, Apprise has been introduced as a service for sending notifications. The settings can be managed directly from the app. Once the changes are saved, you can restart the Watchdog from the UI to apply the new user configurations.

To correctly configure the notification delivery services, you can refer to the [official Apprise documentation](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)

If you are using email notifications, for proper formatting, add &format=markdown to your request.
