# Overview

The VUI project was developed with Cloud-native architecture in mind. From the outset, the goal was to create a project composed of multiple microservices that could be easily deployed on Kubernetes clusters, ensuring straightforward maintenance and facilitating future enhancements.

During the installation process, you have the option to select your preferred installation type.

For those managing a single cluster, or if you prefer to deploy an isolated installation even when multiple clusters are available, the single cluster option is ideal.

However, if you oversee multiple clusters and wish to centralize management through a unified dashboard, the multi-cluster installation is the recommended choice.
