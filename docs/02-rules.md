   - Make sure to understand and respect the project's license. Use the code in accordance with the terms set by the repository's creator.

4. **Provide Constructive Feedback**:
   - When reporting bugs or requesting new features, provide clear and constructive feedback. Detail the issues and your suggestions with concrete examples.

5. **Contribute Actively**:
   - If you find the project useful, consider contributing with code, documentation, translations, or anything else that can improve the repository.

6. **Leave a Star**:
   - **Before requesting new features**, show your appreciation by leaving a star on the repository on GitHub. This helps increase the project's visibility and motivates the developers.
