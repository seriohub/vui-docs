## Getting Started

**VUI (Velero User Interface)** is a modular suite of tools designed to simplify Velero backup operations through an intuitive web interface. It includes the following core components:

- [`vui-api`](https://github.com/seriohub/vui-api) – Agent module
- [`vui-ui`](https://github.com/seriohub/vui-ui) – Web user interface
- [`vui-watchdog`](https://github.com/seriohub/vui-watchdog) – Notification service
- `vui-core` – Multi-cluster orchestration

Additional modules are available for deployment and documentation:

- [`velero-helm`](https://github.com/seriohub/velero-helm) – Helm chart for simplified installation
- [`vui-docs`](https://github.com/seriohub/vui-docs) – Project documentation

## Features

Learn more in the [Overview](/docs/getting-started/overview.md), which includes screenshots and feature descriptions.

## Installation

We strongly recommend using **Helm** to install VUI, as it simplifies deployment and minimizes manual configuration.  
You can follow the [Helm installation guide](getting-started/installation/helm-installation) for step-by-step instructions.

For faster setup, we also provide [predefined scenario templates](getting-started/installation/scenarios/installation-scenarios) with minimal override files tailored to common use cases.
