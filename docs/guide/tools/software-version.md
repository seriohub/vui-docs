## Software version

The tool lets you verify if a new version of software components has been released. It compares the version currently running with the latest version available on VUI's public GitHub repositories.

A quick visual indicator is provided by the icon/link button (in the top right-hand corner) ![software-vs-icon](./../../assets/screenshots/41_app_button_check.png): if the icon is **not green**, it's recommended to click on the icon and review the changelog for any new updates.

The popup page shows a detailed report: for each module the running version, latest version from Github and the direct link to the changelog file.
