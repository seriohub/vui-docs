# Project Vision and Sustainability

What began as a small open-source tool has grown into something much larger â€” thanks to the incredible support from the community and the generosity of our [sponsor](/sponsors), who make continued development possible.

Iâ€™d like to share an important update with full transparency:

**The single-cluster installation of VUI â€” including `vui-ui`, `vui-api`, and `vui-watchdog` â€” will always remain open source.**  
These components form the foundation of the standalone experience and will continue to be freely available, maintained, and improved for the community.

To ensure the long-term sustainability of the project and to accelerate its development, Iâ€™m introducing a new component: **VUI-Core** â€” a Pro module that enables centralized management of multiple clusters.

This component will offer advanced features, including:

- Centralized access and control across multiple clusters  
- Advanced monitoring and operational visibility  
- A foundation for building automated, multi-cluster workflows

The Core will be available **exclusively to project sponsors**.

## Why this change?

The goal is to create a win-win situation:

- Keep VUI open and useful for the entire community  
- Provide additional value to those who believe in and support the project's future

**The decision to keep the standalone components open is not temporary â€” itâ€™s a long-term commitment.**  

**`Vui-core`** is an optional addition, not a replacement. Future development will continue to follow this principle: an open, fully functional standalone experience, with optional Pro features.

Any future Pro features will be clearly communicated and will never compromise the usability or completeness of the open-source version.

If you would like to support VUI and gain access to the Pro module, you can become a sponsor here:

Thank you for making this possible.  
Your trust and support are what make this journey sustainable.

## Why Sponsoring Matters

Maintaining an open source project requires time, effort, and long-term commitment.  
By sponsoring VUI, youâ€™re helping to:

- Keep the standalone version free and open for everyone  
- Accelerate the development of new features  
- Improve stability, support, and documentation  
- Ensure the long-term health of the project

Sponsorships allow me to dedicate focused time to building and improving VUI for the benefit of all users.

If you or your organization rely on VUI or want to support its future, please consider becoming a sponsor:
