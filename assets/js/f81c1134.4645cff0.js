This release introduces structural changes, new installation options, and support for advanced components.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\ud83d\udea8 **Breaking Changes**\\n\\nWith this version, the Helm chart structure has been completely refactored. Deprecated fields have been removed, new required values introduced, and the entire layout optimized for clarity and maintainability.\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f This version is not backward-compatible with previous releases (e.g. 0.1.27). Please refer to the updated templates for [scenario-based](/docs/getting-started/installation/scenarios/overview) installations.\\n\\n\ud83c\udd95 **Core Support**\\n\\nThis release introduces support for the new [core](/docs/getting-started/installation/scenarios/core-cluster) component\u2014a powerful foundation designed to extend the platform\u2019s capabilities. While still in early stages, it represents a fundamental building block for advanced functionality.\\n\\nOrganizations with access to this component can now deploy it directly via Helm. This marks an important step in our effort to offer modular extensibility to those contributing most actively to the project\u2019s growth.\\n\\n\ud83d\udee0 **Improvements & Installation Scenarios**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added dedicated templates for different usage contexts:\\n\\n- Single cluster (standard)\\n- Single cluster No authentication\\n- Single cluster with LDAP authentication\\n- Core\\n- Core with LDAP authentication\\n- Agent-only\\n\\nThese scenarios simplify the deployment process and offer a clearer starting point for varied infrastructures. The application can be deployed in many different ways using the values.yaml file; the templates provided are tailored to the most common and standard use cases.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd04 **Component Updates**\\n\\n- \ud83d\udce6 appVersion updated to 0.3.0\\n- \ud83d\ude80 API updated to 0.2.5\\n- \ud83c\udfa8 UI updated to 0.2.5\\n- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Watchdog updated to 0.1.8\\n\\nThis release focuses on robustness, clarity, and forward compatibility. We encourage you to explore the new installation options and follow the evolving roadmap.
